# Mandelbrot-GUI
These classes create a Mandelbrot GUI and allow the user to move around the complex plane and zoom in and out
The Complex class creates a point in the complex plane and then with methods (namely doIterations) in the MandelbrotGUI class we can check to see if that point is in the mandlebrot set after a 100 iterations.
The folder "buttonPics" needs to be in the same directory as the program for the buttons to have pictures
